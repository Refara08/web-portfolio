        Frontend Developer - Freelance
      </h3>
      <p>
        I am currently freelancing as frontend web developer on a small team
        group. We mainly offer online wedding invitation card making services.
        In addition, we also work on website landing pages for Small and Medium
        Enterprises (SMEs) businesses.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        During my time freelancing in this group, I have created online wedding
        invitation card templates as Reactjs reusable components, which include
        countdown, RSVP, and congratulation comments features.
      </p>
    </>
