desc: "This weather website application is one of the first website I made when I was in the early stages of learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The development of this weather web app uses the openweathermap API, and the unsplash API. The way this website works is that at first the website will ask for permission from the user to get the user's location information for auto-detection of the weather at the user's location, if allowed, the website will update the local weather data, and background images related to the user's location. In addition, on this website, users can also search for weather information in any location by searching in the 'search' column, after having the desired location the website will update the weather data and background images that are appropriate or related to the desired location."
