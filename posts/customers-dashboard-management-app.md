# Hungray Landing Page

Hungray landing page is a fake project for a restaurant that provides an online ordering feature through their website. This website has a cart feature, built using the react hook useContext, to easily propagate state data across all components. There is also a filter feature on the menu based on the type of meal, to make it easier to find a particular food. In the future, a login feature for admins will be built so that restaurants can change information on available menus, best-selling items, recommended items, and others. This project is still in development and is one of my side projects.
